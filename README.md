This is just my neovim config.

I've tried to get started with nvim a couple times, and often found that I was way over-using 
other people's settings and configs and didn't understand what I actually had installed, which 
meant when I ran into weird plugin errors I wasn't equipped to fix them.

My goal here is to add as little as possible for a comfortable setup, and to move forward by removing 
things I don't use, rather than adding things I want to use.

Huge shout-out to the walkthrough [here](https://rsdlt.github.io/posts/rust-nvim-ide-guide-walkthrough-development-debug/).
Apologies to anyone else whose work I've ripped off.
